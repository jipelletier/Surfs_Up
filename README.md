# Surfs_Up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy analyze the temperature in Hawaii to better asses the probability of success in opening a surf shop in Oahu. He is wanting to understand if a surf and ice cream shop is a business that can be profitable year-round venture before he invests in the business. We will be using temperature data from various stations in the area and comparing June temperatures across several years to December temperatures.

## Results
- In June there are 1,700 records: the highest temperature recorded was 85 degrees and never went below 64 degrees. Temperatures in June seem to stay mainly in the 70s and the average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees.
- In December there are 1,517 records: the highest temperature recorded was 83 degrees and the lowest temperature reached 56. Temperatures in June December get a little colder than June but only by about 10 degrees and still tend to to stay mainly in the very low 70s with the average temperature at 71.
- 75% of the time, the temperature is 73 or higher in June and 69 or higher in December.
- The minimum temperature in December drops to 56 degrees and June's minimum is 64 degrees.
- The average temperature in June is almost 4 degrees higher than December.

## Summary
### Recommendation Based on Temperature Analysis

Given that 69 degrees F is considered warm enough for surfers to be out in December, we would expect surfers to get out and be at the shop at least 75% of the days. Given the overall temperature statistics at two very different times in the year, I recommend that Oahu would be a good place for a surf shop. It would also be important to have an understanding of how temperature affects ice-cream sales, to help W. Avy understand the potential with the ice-cream opporunity as well as the surfs shop revenue.

### Recommendation to Analyze Precipitation Levels

I recommend also taking a look at the precipitation levels and the statistics in each month around that measure. It might help us understand how many good surfing days we should expect in each of these months. While adding in precipitation, we may want to plot on a chart the temperatures vs. precipitation to see if there are any correlations.

We can use the same procedure to compare the amount of rain (in inches) over the years as we did for temperature. Below are two additional queries that filter the precipitation levels for the months of June and December. Looking at the data below, we see that while there is definitely rain in Hawaii year round, the rain is not so abundant that it would effect the ideal surf/ice cream weather. June tends to have less rain than December.
